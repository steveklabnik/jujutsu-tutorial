# More advanced workflows

The workflows we've seen in `jj` are different from `git` in the best ways. As we
get a bit more advanced, there are some very impressive possibilities yet to
see. This section will also address an interesting aspect of interoperability
between `jj` and `git`: colocated repositories.

Here's what we're going to learn:

* Working on all your branches simultaneously
* A pull request workflow called "Stacked PRs"
* Workspaces that let you have multiple local checkouts
* Using `git` and `jj` at the same time with colocated repositories
