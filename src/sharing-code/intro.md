# Sharing your code with others

One of the best parts about using a version control system is the ability to
share that code with other people. So far, we've been using `jj` entirely
on our own machine, but it's time to explore how we can interface with tools
that let us collaborate.

Here's what we're going to learn:

* Using named branches in jj
* Working with remotes, aka, GitHub
* Adding commits to a pull request
* How to use `jj` with Gerrit rather than GitHub
